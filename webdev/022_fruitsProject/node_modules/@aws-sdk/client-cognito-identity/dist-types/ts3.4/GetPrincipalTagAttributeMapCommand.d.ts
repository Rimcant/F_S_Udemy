 * Parse Range header field, capping to the given `size`.

 * the case of a byte range this is of course the total number of bytes. If the
 * Range header field is not given `undefined` is returned, `-1` when unsatisfiable,
 * and `-2` when syntactically invalid.
 *
 * When ranges are returned, the array has a "type" property which is the type of
 * range that is required (most commonly, "bytes"). Each array element is an object
 * with a "start" and "end" property for the portion of the range.
 *
 * The "combine" option can be set to `true` and overlapping & adjacent ranges
 * will be combined into a single range.
 *
 * NOTE: remember that ranges are inclusive, so for example "Range: users=0-3"
 * should respond with 4 users when available, not 3.
