# BSON parser

BSON is short for "Binary JSON," and is the binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. You can learn more about it in [the specification](http://bsonspec.org).

This browser version of the BSON parser is compiled using [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and the current version is pre-compiled in the `dist` directory.

This is the default BSON parser, however, there is a C++ Node.js addon version as well that does not support the browser. It can be found at [mongod-js/bson-ext](https://github.com/mongodb-js/bson-ext).
