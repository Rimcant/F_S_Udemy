## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript CognitoIdentity Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</fullname>

<p>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary
credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a
device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an
application.</p>
<p>Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or
more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon
Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.
Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider
trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
credentials.</p>
<p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide
see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html">Authentication Flow</a>.</p>
