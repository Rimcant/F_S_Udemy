 *          that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other

 *          <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the
 *          following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code>
 *                (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>You can do either because the roleâ€™s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based
 *          policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no
 *          additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and
 *          resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the
 *             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
