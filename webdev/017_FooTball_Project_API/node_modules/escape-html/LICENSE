### SocksClient

SocksClient establishes SOCKS proxy connections to remote destination hosts. These proxy connections are fully transparent to the server and once established act as full duplex streams. SOCKS v4, v4a, v5, and v5h are supported, as well as the connect, bind, and associate commands.

SocksClient supports creating connections using callbacks, promises, and async/await flow control using two static factory functions createConnection and createConnectionChain. It also internally extends EventEmitter which results in allowing event handling based async flow control.
