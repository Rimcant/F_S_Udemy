/**
 * Creates a credential provider function that reads from a shared credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials` and a
 * shared configuration file at `~/.aws/config`. Both files are expected to be INI formatted with section names
 * corresponding to profiles. Sections in the credentials file are treated as profile names, whereas profile sections in
 * the config file must have the format of`[profile profile-name]`, except for the default profile.
 *
 * Profiles that appear in both files will not be merged, and the version that appears in the credentials file will be
 * given precedence over the profile found in the config file.
