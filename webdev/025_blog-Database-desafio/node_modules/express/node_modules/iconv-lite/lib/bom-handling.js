eam, watching for new changes (insertions, updates,
     * replacements, deletions, and invalidations) in this database. Will ignore all
     * changes to system collections.
     *
     * @remarks
     * watch() accepts two generic arguments for distinct use cases:
     * - The first is to provide the schema that may be defined for all the collections within this database
     * - The second is to override the shape of the change stream document entirely, if it is not provided the type will default to ChangeStreamDocument of the first argument
     *
     * @param pipeline - An array of {@link https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/|aggregation pipeline stages} through which to pass change stream documents. This allows for filtering (using $match) and manipulating the change stream documents.
     * @param options - Optional settings for the command
     * @typeParam TSchema - Type of the data being detected by the change stream
     * @typeParam TChange - Type of the whole change stream document emitted
