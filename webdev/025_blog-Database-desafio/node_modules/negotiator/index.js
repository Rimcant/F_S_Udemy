## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript SSOOIDC Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI
or a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to
fetch the user’s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with
IAM Identity Center.</p>
<note>
<p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and
<code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for
backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p>
</note>
<p>
<b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b>
</p>
<p>Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following
important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0
Device Authorization Grant standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>) that are necessary to enable single
sign-on authentication with the AWS CLI. Support for other OIDC flows frequently needed
for native applications, such as Authorization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in
future releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new token (For
example, token refresh) requires explicit user re-authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all AWS account
entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just a particular application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access
token into AWS Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected AWS service
endpoints. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference
Guide</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is
IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User Guide</i>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `SSOOIDCClient` and
the commands you need, for example `CreateTokenCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { SSOOIDCClient, CreateTokenCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { SSOOIDCClient, CreateTokenCommand }
