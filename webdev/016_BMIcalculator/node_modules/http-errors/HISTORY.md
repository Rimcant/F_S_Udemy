         * For UDP sockets, causes the `dgram.Socket` to listen for datagram
         * messages on a named `port` and optional `address`. If `port` is not
         * specified or is `0`, the operating system will attempt to bind to a
         * random port. If `address` is not specified, the operating system will
         * attempt to listen on all addresses. Once binding is complete, a`'listening'` event is emitted and the optional `callback` function is
         * called.
         *
         * Specifying both a `'listening'` event listener and passing a`callback` to the `socket.bind()` method is not harmful but not very
         * useful.

         * A bound datagram socket keeps the Node.js process running to receive
         * datagram messages.
         *
         * If binding fails, an `'error'` event is generated. In rare case (e.g.
         * attempting to bind with a closed socket), an `Error` may be thrown.
