 can be converted to their byte representation with `toByteArray()`.
(Actually, JavaScript mostly does not know about byte buffers. They are emulated with
arrays of numbers, each in range of 0..255.)

```js
var bytes = ipaddr.parse('2a00:1450:8007::68').toByteArray(); // ipv6.google.com
bytes // => [42, 0x00, 0x14, 0x50, 0x80, 0x07, 0x00, <zeroes...>, 0x00, 0x68 ]
```

The `ipaddr.IPv4` and `ipaddr.IPv6` objects have some methods defined, too. All of them
have the same interface for both protocols, and are similar to global methods.

`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` can be used to check if the string is a valid address
for particular protocol, and `ipaddr.IPvX.parse(string)` is the error-throwing parser.

`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` uses the same format for parsing as the POSIX `i
