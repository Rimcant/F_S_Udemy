Destroy a stream.

This module is meant to ensure a stream gets destroyed, handling different APIs
and Node.js bugs.

## API

```js
var destroy = require('destroy')
```

### destroy(stream)

Destroy the given stream. In most cases, this is identical to a simple
`stream.destroy()` call. The rules are as follows for a given stream:

  1. If the `stream` is an instance of `ReadStream`, then call `stream.destroy()`
     and add a listener to the `open` event to call `stream.close()` if it is
     fired. This is for a Node.js bug that will leak a file descriptor if
     `.destroy()` is called before `open`.
  2. If the `stream` is not an instance of `Stream`, then nothing happens.
  3. If the `stream` has a `.destroy()` method, then call it.

The function returns the `stream` passed in as the argument.

## Example

```js
var destroy = require('destroy')

var fs = require('fs')
var stream = fs.createReadStream('package.json')
